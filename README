This is the branch that I (David Medine) made of the cmuartfab/Udoo repository.

Inside you will find three folders: comport/ gpio/ and tutorials/. The former utilities for interfacing your Udoo peripherals with Miller Puckette's audio programming environment Pure Data http://msp.ucsd.edu. 

tutorials/ has a directory called pd_comport_gpio/. Here you will find a file called tutorial.xhtml that steps through getting started with all this stuff. Example patches and Arduino sketches are included.

More Udoo/Pd related tutorials are coming.

[gpio] is an external authored by Puckette. David Medine has adjusted the makefile so that it will build on Udoo. 

[comport] is a serial data transfer extern developed by Martin Peach: http://puredata.info/downloads/comport/releases/0.2. 

Please email me with any quistions or concerns: dmedine@ucsd.edu.

Thank you to Brendan Gaffney for proofreading and suggestions on the tutorial.
