#X text 245 -88 gpio is a pd extern by Miller Puckette. The make file
was adjusted slightly for building on the UDOO board by David Medine
;
#X text 242 -23 This patch demonstrates your basic led on/off configuration.
This first thing you must know is what pin corresponds to what gpio
number. gpio 88 corresponds to pin 53 on the UDOO board. You can download
a map of these relationships from the UDOO site.;
#X text 240 56 In the current UDOO kernel \, all the gpios are already
enabled by linux will enable right away once they have been unenabled.
I don't know why \, but this is so. So you don't have to enable them.
But \, you do have to open the pin's file : open 1 \, and set it to
output mode: output 1 The patch is set up to do that on startup;
#X text 238 170 Then you can toggle your led on and off.;
