This is Miller Puckette's gpio extern for Pd originally intended for the Raspberry Pi. David Medine has edited the makefile.include so that it will build on the UDOO. Eventually both build options should be integrated into a single distrobution.

To build it, unzip and put the gpio folder inside of /<path to pd>/extra folder. Then simply hit make.
