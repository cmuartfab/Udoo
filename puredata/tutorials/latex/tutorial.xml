  <title>Setting up UDOO to work with Pd: using [gpio] and [comport]</title>
  <para xml:id="p1">
    <p>This tutorial explains how to get set up using the Arduino built in to your UDOO with Miller Puckette’s audio programming environment, Pure Data. The following is geared towards people that are Linux noobs or that are not used to interfacing with and OS through the command line (as God intended). If you are a true Linux beginner, you might want to check out some of the tutorials on the UDOO website <ref class="ltx_url" href="http://www.udoo.org/tutorials/"><text font="typewriter">http://www.udoo.org/tutorials/</text></ref>. Anyway, for more advanced Linux users, much of this might seem old-hat. On the other hand, if I am unclear, please let me know (dmedine(at)ucsd.edu).<break/></p>

    <para xml:id="S1.p1">
      <p>First of all, there is a nice tutorial on how to get Pd-extended on the UDOO forums: here (<ref class="ltx_url" href="http://www.udoo.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=27&amp;t=478&amp;p=3827&amp;hilit=puredata#p3827"><text font="typewriter">Ωhttp://www.udoo.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=27&amp;t=478&amp;p=3827&amp;hilit=puredata#p3827</text></ref>). Pd vanilla is the core of the Pd program written and maintained by Miller Puckette. Even that ships with a few ‘extra’ objects such as [pique ], [sigmund ], and (notoriously) [pd ]. These are external objects written by Miller, but not officially part of Pd itself. Pd-extended is Pd plus dozens and dozens of extras written by third party developers. Many of these are truly excellent pieces of software, but there is also a lot of (in my opinion, anyway) stuff that isn’t really needed. It is good to stick with Pd vanilla for development purposes, because it ensures greater compatibility from user to user. Nevertheless, sometimes one needs objects from Pd-extended to do this or that. My approach has been to merely take what I need from Pd-extended by only building those objects that are truly necessary for my own projects to succeed. The third section of this tutorial is just such an example. There, it is explained how to build and install [comport] by Martin Peach so that we can pipe in serial data coming from Arduino into a Pd patch and vice-versa.<break/></p>

    <para xml:id="S3.p1">
      <p>Now that we can send data between Arduino and Linux, we can route that data into a Pd patch. In order to do this, we need a Pd extern called [comport]. [comport] ships with Pd-extended (as do many, many other third party Pd externs) but you don’t have to get the whole Pd-extended package in order to have just [comport].<break/></p>

In order to build it, you will have to make one alteration to the Makefile. You need to tell make where the file m_pd.h is. This file is in Pd’s src directory that we visited before when we built pd. So, to do this, under the line in the Makefile that says:<break/></p>

      <p>It should compile without errors. So now, all that is left is to tell Pd where the binary for the [comport] object lives. To do this, open up Pd (cd into the bin folder and hit ./pd). Navigate to the menu <text font="typewriter">Edit-&gt;preferences-&gt;path…</text> and add the path that you put your comport-0.2 folder into. The ‘New…’ button opens up a gui so you can navigate there. Make sure the ‘Use standard extensions’ box is checked. Then click Apply and hit OK. Now you have [comport] in Pd vanilla.<break/></p>

      <p>Presumably your simple Arduino sketch that prints out ‘Hello, world!’ is still running. If not, start it up again.

      <p>At this point, if you are at all familiar with Arduino and Pd, you should have what you need to use your Arduino as a control mechanism for Pd on UDOO. Be careful not to access pins via the OS (ie with gpio object for Pd) whilst running an Arduino sketch that uses the same pins. This will damage your board. Another disclaimer, close down your connection to /dev/ttyS0 before putting a new sketch on your Arduino over the serial port. ttyS0 is doing double duty as a communications relay, and the port through which we upload sketches to the the chip, and we can’t do both at the same time. If you have problems, a power cycle never hurts.<break/></p>

      <p>I have also created a Pd patch and associated Arduio sketch called ‘basic_serial_io’. The Pd patch and associated Arduino sketch can be found in this directory as well. The folder is the Arduino sketch which you should be able to open up with the Arduino IDE. The Pd patch is the file that (duh) ends in ‘.pd’.</p>

      <p>One note, this patch relies on an abstraction that I wrote called ‘byte_trans_abs’. This should be in the same directory as all the rest of the files associated with this tutorial – a quick link is here: <ref class="ltx_url" href="byte_trans_abs.pd"><text font="typewriter">byte_trans_abs.pd</text></ref>. The abstraction takes in n number of bytes and translates them into an integer value.</p>
    </para>
    <para xml:id="S4.p4">
      <p>This abstraction works by knowing that the method Serial.println in Arduino will terminate a transmission of <emph>n</emph> number of bytes with the ascii characters 13 then 10. These characters are used as cues to know that the data is done coming in and that it is time to translate the word into an integer. I made these cues arguments tot he abstraction so that one can provide any cue to end a transmission. It is a lot harder to translate characters into words with Pd than it is to translate a stream of single values between 0 and 9 into the correct integer. This would be a challenging and useful Pd patch to create!</p>
