This is the David Medine branch of the cmuartfab/Udoo repository.

Inside you will find three folders, comport, gpio, and tutorials. These are utilities for interfacing your Udoo peripherals with Miller Puckette's audio programming environment Pure Data http://msp.ucsd.edu.

[gpio] is an external authored by Puckette. David Medine has adjusted the makefile so that it will build on Udoo. A built copy for revD is included.

[comport] is a serial data transfer extern developed by Martin Peach: http://puredata.info/downloads/comport/releases/0.2. Again, a build of this extern is included. 

In the tutorials folder you will find an html tutorial (called tutorial.xhtml) on installing Pd vanilla from the command line as well as getting started with [comport]. Example patches and Arduino sketches are included.
